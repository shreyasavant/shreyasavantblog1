The DARQ Age is here...
Distributed Ledger Technology
Artificial Intelligence
Extended Reality
Quantum Computing

Technology has brought about enormous chamges in the world. Never in their wildest dreams had people 100 years ago ever thought about touching a glass surface to contact a person 1000 kms away or seeing a metal piece speak and move like humans. But it'sall true now and so will many such imaginations which seem far-fetched right now.
Digital Immortality, Humanoids, Dependable Self- Driving Cars and other means of transport, Drones, Levitating tech, etc. do not pose much of doubt in the millennials nowadays.
Revolution is inevitable and so to keep up with the ever growing Tech Communitywe have to keep enhancing our knowledge and resourcesto best match the current scenario.
DARQ is a term used to refer some of the new age Technologies which are in their early stages of development or deployment. The tech industry has its fare share of buzzwords and hypesbut DARQ is here to stay to say tge least.
The DARQ includes
i) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): DLT is like a database that exists across the different users or participants of the given service. This eliminates the generally used central database system which has a lot of drawbacks. DLT is used in security purposes and money transactions. And has applications like Blockchain.
ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence has been one of tge driving forces of the digital transformation the companies and industry are going through. It has a wide variety of applications and is exponentially growingin its use cases. AI is basically teaching a machine how to be a human. And do jobs of ranging importance. AI is the application of machine learning, and AI has brought about huge success in variety of fields including healthcare and space exploration.
iii) Extended Reality (XR): Extended Reality refers to digital reality. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are nowadays as good as real universe. The experiences we get through XR are nearly unbelievable and true to life. Personally I got a chance to use Oculus Rift a couple of months ago and I was stunned.The market for XR is growing exponentially and is estimated to be 8 times more than it is today in just 2 years.
iv) Quantum Computing: My personal favorite topic which holds the power of disrupting many recent digital transformations is Quantum Computing. Quantum Computing made a lot of noise recently when Google announcedtheor 54 qubit quantum Computer. A qubit is like a traditional bit but it can hold 3(1 / 0 / 1/0) cases unlike the traditional two (1 / 0). Understanding functioning of Quantum Computers requires open-mindedness and knowledge of a physics. But in general terms Quantum Computers using Quantum Mechanics and the properties like entanglement, superposition, etc. to perform complex calculations. In the near future Quantum Computers will be widely used in simulations and Complex mathematical calculations which are not possible for the traditional Computers.
